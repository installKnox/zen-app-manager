# 🗺️ Project Roadmap

Here are the features and improvements planned for future releases of Zen App Manager.

## 🚀 Upcoming Features

- [ ] **Systemd Service Management (Advanced Mode)**
    - Allow users to view and manage system-level services (systemd).
    - This will likely require root/admin privileges and will be separated into an "Advanced" section to prevent accidental system changes.
    - *Note: This feature might be limited in the Flatpak version due to sandbox restrictions.*

- [ ] **Multi-Language Support (i18n)**
    - Add support for multiple languages (Turkish, Spanish, German, etc.) in the UI.

- [ ] **Detailed Analytics**
    - Show more details about startup impact (boot time measurement).
